  <h1>Privacy Policy for Funcalc.fun</h1>

  <p>
    Your privacy is paramount to us. This policy explains how <strong>Funcalc.fun</strong> 
    (owned and managed by <strong>FunCalc</strong>) handles information related to analytics, 
    advertising, and affiliate tracking while ensuring a safe user experience.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Data Use and Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    We use trusted third-party services such as 
    <strong>Google AdSense</strong>, <strong>Google Analytics</strong>, and 
    <strong>affiliate tracking platforms</strong> (e.g., ActiveCampaign, HubSpot) to 
    improve performance and display relevant ads. These services may place 
    cookies on your device to collect <em>non-personal data</em> such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>IP address (for regional targeting)</li>
    <li>Browser type and device information</li>
    <li>Pages visited and interaction time</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store personally identifiable information (PII) 
    unless you explicitly provide it through a contact form or email.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Cookies and Consent</h2>
  <p>
    By using <strong>Funcalc.fun</strong>, you agree to our use of cookies for 
    essential website functionality, analytics, and personalized ads. You can 
    manage or disable cookies anytime in your browser settings.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Affiliate Disclosure (Earning Trust)</h2>
  <p>
    Some pages, including those on <strong>pro.funcalc.fun</strong>, contain affiliate 
    links. If you click these links and make a purchase, we may earn a small 
    commission — at no extra cost to you. These commissions help us keep our 
    calculators and tools completely free.
  </p>

  <h2>4. External Links</h2>
  <p>
    Our website may link to external pages for reference, products, or resources. 
    We are not responsible for their privacy practices or content, and we recommend 
    reviewing their individual privacy policies before interacting with them.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We prioritize data security. No financial or sensitive data is stored on 
    our servers — all calculations happen in real-time within your browser for 
    full privacy.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Updates to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect new services or 
    legal requirements. Any changes will be posted on this page with the updated 
    date below.
